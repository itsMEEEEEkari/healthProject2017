  <h1 class=title>{Anxiety Disorders}</h1>
  <p class=introPara>Anxiety disorders are very common today, but many people do not seek help. Sometimes it is because they cannot recognize their symptoms, and sometimes it is because they are afraid of being diagnosed. This website was designed to solve those problems: to provide easily identified symptoms and to give people resources to help deal with these disorders. Anxiety disorders are fairly curable today through therapy and/or medication, but you should always check with a doctor or therapist. There are also lists of self-help books and workbooks and links to websites that can help you connect with a therapist. If you think there is even a small possibility you suffer from one of the disorders listed, try the online screening or contact a therapist or counselor. Many Anxiety Disorders are also tied to other mental health issues like depression, so also be aware that it may not be just one disorder with which you are dealing.</p>

    <h1 class="titleStats">Statistics</h1>
    <p class="statistics">Overall, anxiety disorders affect about 18% of the United States adult population, but it is estimated that with the undiagnosed disorders, this number is closer to 30%. Of these people, only about 36% will get treatment, and only 12% will get proper treatment. These disorders also affect the country economically. The US spent almost $42 billion on Anxiety DIsorders, almost â…“ of their mental health costs.</p>

    <h1 class="titleHelp">Help</h1>
    <p class="help">Finding help for anxiety disorders is not as difficult as some people may think. Websites like the Anxiety and Depression Association of America and the National Institute of Mental Health are excellent resources for learning about anxiety disorders and for seeking treatment. There are numerous books written on how to overcome, deal with, and live with anxiety disorders. There are even a number of teen novels being published that feature characters who deal with these disorders, which can be very helpful for teens or young adults struggling with an anxiety disorder.</p>
